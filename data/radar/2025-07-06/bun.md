# Bun.sh

## About

Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime built for speed, combining a runtime, package manager, bundler, and test runner in a single tool. Built from scratch using Zig, it aims to be a drop-in replacement for Node.js while offering significantly faster performance for both development and production workloads.\n

## Reasoning

Bun has shown impressive performance gains and developer experience improvements that could benefit MOHARA's development workflow. Its all-in-one approach could simplify our toolchain and reduce build times significantly. However, as a relatively young technology (1.x), we need to evaluate its stability, ecosystem compatibility, and long-term viability before broader adoption.

Key considerations for assessment:
- Performance benchmarks show 3-4x improvements that could accelerate our CI/CD pipelines
- Built-in TypeScript and bundling could replace multiple tools in our current stack
- Need to verify compatibility with our existing npm dependencies and Node.js APIs
- Growing rapidly with frequent releases - need to monitor stability and breaking changes
- Community and enterprise adoption still emerging compared to Node.js

Recommended assessment approach:
- Run proof-of-concept with non-critical internal tooling
- Benchmark against our current Node.js setup for real workloads
- Test compatibility with our key dependencies
- Monitor community adoption and stability over next quarter
