[v0 Model API](https://vercel.com/docs/v0/api) is Vercel's specialized AI model (v0-1.0-md) designed specifically for building modern web applications. The v0-1.0-md model is designed for building modern web applications. It supports text and image inputs, provides fast streaming responses, and is compatible with the OpenAI Chat Completions API format.

Available through an API, the model can be prompted with text or images, and was "optimized for front-end and full-stack web development." Currently in beta, it requires a V0 Premium plan ($20 per month) or Team plan ($30 per user per month). The v0 model supports integration with platforms such as Cursor and Codex, enhancing code generation and user interface capabilities.
