[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) is an AI-first code editor that combines the power of large language models with a modern development environment. Built on top of VSCode, it offers advanced AI features like chat-based code generation, intelligent code explanations, and automated refactoring capabilities.

MOHARA has fully adopted Cursor as part of our development toolkit. Its natural language code generation and integrated AI assistance have proven to be highly effective, complementing our existing tools like GitHub Copilot. The ability to have conversational interactions with the codebase and its VSCode foundation have enhanced our development workflow, improving productivity and code quality. Our teams leverage its AI features for code generation, refactoring, and understanding complex codebases.
